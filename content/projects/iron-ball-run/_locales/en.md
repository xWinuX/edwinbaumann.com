# Iron Ball Run
Iron Ball Run was a game made for the GMTK Game Jam 2021 , the theme of the jam was "Joined Together".
I participated alone, so everything was made by me.
A full playthrough can be seen in the video below, or you can play it yourself with the link at the bottom of the page.

## Features
In Iron Ball Run you finally managed to escape your prison cell, but you still need to escape the prison itself.
Unfortunately, you still got an iron ball attached to your ankle, but you can use that to your advantage.
The iron ball is very heavy you can still jump, but you can't take it with you.

You can use the chain to swing from ceilings and reach stuff you normally couldn't.

And you can even use the ball as a weapon to take out guards.

## Reflection

### What I learned

#### Iron ball movement
The movement together with the iron ball was definitely the most challenging thing to implement.
Having two entities that are tied to each other was something I haven't really done before, so figuring all this stuff out
was certainly tricky.
But I'm overall pretty happy with how the movement turned out, and there aren't any major bugs that occur.

### Things that could be better

#### More Levels
Since the movement took so long to program, I haven't had that much time to design levels.
So the overall number of levels and their quality leave a bit to be desired.
