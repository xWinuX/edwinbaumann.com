# C# Socket Chat
C# Socket Chat was a small project I needed to do for my studies. 
It involved making a console chat application using only sockets.
Since I wanted to look at form creation in C#, I also used WPF to create a UI for it.
A Demo can be viewed below:

::video-player{src="../media/demo.mp4"}

## Features
When the application starts, the user can select if he either wants to host a server or join one.
The Interfaces for both look almost the same, the user can choose an ip and a port that are to host/join the server.
The only difference is in the join server interface where a user can also choose a name.

## Reflection

### What I learned

#### Sockets
I've played around with sockets a bit before but never really used them for a project until now.
It was quite interesting to see what all networking libraries really do in the background and how easy they make certain things.

#### WPF
This was the first time I've used WPF, though I used WinForm a long time ago in school.
It was quite hard to get into, especially because my IDE of choice, Rider, didn't have a Visual Editor, so I hat to write the XAML manually.
But once I got a bit of experience, it was really easy to use.

## Results

### Source Code
The project is fully open source and available here: [https://github.com/xWinuX/Chat](https://github.com/xWinuX/Chat)
