# DIE.ce
DIE.ce was a game made for the 30th GM48, the theme of the jam was "No Death State".
I did all the programming and audio, and a friend of mine did all the art.
A full playthrough can be seen in the video below, or you can play it yourself with the link at the bottom of the page.

## Features
In DIE.ce your girlfriend gets kidnapped and you need to save her.
You can only move, jump, and interact with NPC's in the world.

But there is also one more thing most video game characters can do, and that's dying.
When you die, the game isn't over; your spirit leaves your body and can continue to move around the world.

While in spirit form you jump higher and are impervious to damage, but you also can't leave the current level.
So the only choice you’ve left is possessing NPC's that are still alive.

There are a number of puzzle elements in the game, these include:
- Pressure plates that can only be activated when the character is heavy enough
- Dead bodies that can be moved if the character is strong enough
- Spikes that can kill you
- Doors that can be opened by various mechanisms

## Reflection

### What I learned

#### Dynamic player 
Since the game uses a possession mechanic, the player needs to seamlessly swap between a lot of different states.
This was really fun to implement since it required a lot of intertwining systems to work together.

### Things that could be better

#### Possession mini-game not accessible
When trying to possess someone, you’re required to press a sequence of three keys after one another or else it will fail.
These keys are the same ones you use to move (WASD), so they will show up with these labels in the game aswell.
What we didn't think of when making this is that not everyone in the world uses a keyboard layout that has a QWERTZ/QWERTY layout.
There was a lot of feedback from people using the AZERTY layout who found the mini-game too difficult, since they don't have the same layout it was intended to be played on.
In the end we should have used arrows instead of letters for the mini-game, so it's more accessible to people with different layouts.
