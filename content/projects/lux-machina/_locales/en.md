# Lux Machina
Lux Machina was a game made for the 28th GM48, the theme of the jam was "Companion".
I did all the programming and audio, and a friend of mine did all the art and level design.
A full playthrough can be seen in the video below, or you can play it yourself with the link at the bottom of the page.

## Features
In Lux Machina you awake in a strange facility with your arms missing and hear a strange voice.
You will go trough multiple rooms filled with puzzle elements, some you can activate yourself like pressure plates.

But for some you will need the little flying robot that follows you.

The robot can reach places the main character cannot and it can also redirect lasers to activate other mechanisms as well.

The game contains the following puzzle elements:

- Pressure plates that stay activated once touched
- Pressure plates that are only active as long as you stand on them
- Buttons only the robots can reach
- Lasers
- Doors that can be opened by various mechanisms
- Two Robots that redirect the laser horizontally and vertically

## Reflection

### What I learned

#### Laser system
I learned how I can create functional lasers that can be blocked and redirected at different angles.

#### Controlling multiple characters
This was also the first time I ever made a game with more than one controllable character.
So designing a system that can switch between them was quite interesting.

### Things that could be better

#### More content
The game is rather short, and I would have liked to add some more puzzles to it.
There are some remnants of a third robot that would redirect lasers diagonally that could be used for some cool puzzles.

#### Controls are a bit clunky
The controls of switching between the player and the robots in the original submission weren’t very intuitive for most people.
When you're working on a game and test it a lot, you tend to oversee these problems since you’re focused on the game itself, 
so it's always a good idea to get some feedback of someone not working on the game.

#### Debug keys left in
During development, I used the left and right arrow keys to quickly swap between levels to test them more efficiently.
This is a debug-only feature and shouldn't be in the final release, but it slipped in any way and caused some confusion for players when they wanted to move with the arrow keys.
Next time I should use some flags to check for a debug build instead of relying on myself to delete them before release.
