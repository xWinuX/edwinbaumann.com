# Essence
Essence was a game made for the 29th GM48, the theme of the jam was "Colors are important".
I did all the programming and audio, and a friend of mine did all the art and level design.
A full playthrough can be seen in the video below, or you can play it yourself with the link at the bottom of the page.

## Features
The world of Essence consists of four races.
- The blue ones 
- The green ones
- The orange ones
- The red ones

Each race has an orb that grants them their power, but the red ones stole the orb from the blue ones, and it is your job to get it back.
You will go through multiple rooms filled with enemies and friendly NPCs you can talk to.
Your character can do the typical platform moves like jumping and double jumping, moving and crouching. 
You also have a Bow that can either do a normal shot, a double shot, or a piercing shot.

(General video with movement and attacks)

Each enemy and friendly NPC is made of essence reflecting their color.

- Green Essence heals you
- Orange Essence gives you more armor
- Read Essence makes you stronger

Getting red essence is trivial since the red ones are your enemies, but do you have the heart to defeat the friendly ones to heal and get more defense?

You will also lose Essence each time you get hit so be careful.

## Reflection

### What I learned

#### Platforming physics
This was my first time making a platformer game. 
So the entire physics of being able to jump and having gravity was new to me, for simple flat terrain it's pretty straightforward.

#### Persistent data
Even though it's not really used meaningfully, each room saves its state so the player can return to it without everything respawning.
It was my first real dive into data serialization and deserialization.

### Things that could be better

#### Consequences for killing friendly NPCs
Originally there were supposed to be multiple ending depending on how many friendly NPCs you kill, 
but we ran out of time, so nothing really stops you from just killing everyone.  

#### Fast-forwarding dialogues
The dialogues in the game canâ€™t be fast forwarded and need to be played in full before being able to move again.
This is definitely something that should have been implemented, it really wouldn't have been hard either.

#### Lack of SFX
SFX and Music creation is something that neither I nor my friend are good in. 
So I just push it back as far as possible and do it at the end. 
But this time we didn't really have that much time left, so a lot of things are missing SFX and the music is rather lackluster.
