# Time Wizard
Time Wizard was created in the first ever game jam I took part in, the theme of the game jam was "Countdown".
I did all the programming and audio, and a friend of mine did all the Art.
A full playthrough can be seen in the video below, or you can play it yourself with the link at the bottom of the page.

## Features
In Time Wizard you have 7.5 minutes to defeat the Time Wizard that awaits at the end of a dungeon full of enemies.
Each action you take (except walking) will take away additional time from the timer. 
These actions include:

- Dodge rolling
- Shooting
- Taking damage

There are spots in the dungeon where the timer will be paused, and every action (except taking damage) will cost nothing.

There are also hourglasses that can be collected to restore some time.

## Reflection

### What I learned

#### Source Control with a team
This was one of the first times I've used source control with someone else, 
and it required some coordination not required when working alone.
There were certainly some problems at the beginning, but we quickly found a way to make it work.

#### Finishing something
This was also the first time I truly "finished" a game, even if it's just a small one.
When working on big games without a true deadline, I often get lost in details and polishing.
With only 48 hours I went through the whole process of making a game from prototyping to release, and that was a truly valuable experience.

### Things that could be better

#### Time management
Of course, with this being my first game jam, I really had no idea how to best manage the 48 hours I had.
So certain things, of course, took longer than expected, and thus other things had to be cut back or removed entirely.
The lack of proper time management caused most of the problem listed below.

#### Lack of testing caused balancing issues
Testing is something that we didn't really have time for during development, and thus the game isn't balanced all that well.
The best strategy is just rushing past all enemies directly to the boss, which makes the whole level and enemies kind of useless. 
Testing is definitely something I underestimated, it takes a lot of time but is also extremely important.

#### Scrapped mechanics
The game originally had puzzle solving planned as a feature, but it's not really implemented well because of bad time management.
